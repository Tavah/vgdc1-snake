# Video Game Design Club #1: Snake


Hey Guys, today's meeting is just to try and code snake.  I did it in JavaScript as that was the most common use case we had from the questionaire. You're free to code it however you please, but the source code here is made for that.

This build requires Node.js 16, and python3 for the file server.  (I believe python3 is optional for the fileserver, but if you wanted to set up port forwarding so others can use it not connected to your network.)

To start the python server, enter in the terminal `python3 -m http.server <port>`. Of course, the port is any number you'd like, and to access it you can type in `localhost:<port>` into your browser.

Have fun and good luck <3
